#The program uses a database with hardware state changes as well as a time stamp provided or obtained from a beamformed data file.

#First run a check to see if the data base is up to date. If not, you can download a new database. Before the first run, you will also need to download the database.
#wget --no-check-certificate https://proxy.lofar.eu/array_status/STATIONS/DATA/hardware_states_latest.txt -O DATA/hardware_states_latest.txt
#If this is not up to date either, please request a new database from sciencesupport using the topic "hardware states update request"
./check_database.sh DATA/hardware_states_latest.txt *.h5

#If your files are up to date, you can run a command using the h5 file:
python getState.py -s core -m HBA-DUAL -f L466958_AntOff.txt -i L466958_SAP000_B000_S0_P000_bf.h5

#or just using the time of your observation obtained in a different way:
python getState.py -s core -m HBA-DUAL -f test.txt -d "2016-05-23 18:52:00"
