REQUIREMENTS
------------

To use lta-query.py, you also need to install LOFAR LTA client:
http://www.astro-wise.org/losoft/lofar_lta-2.6.0.tar.gz

Instructions on the lofar.org page:
http://www.lofar.org/wiki/doku.php?id=lta:client_installation

cd lofar_lta-1.0
put directory <YOUR PREFIX>/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/ to the PYTHONPATH
python setup.py install_oracle --prefix=<YOUR PREFIX>
python setup.py install --prefix=<YOUR PREFIX>

After the installation have a look at ${HOME}/.awe/Environment.cfg
  - you should at least define your database username and password.

If it does not work, try to substitute your ${HOME}/.awe/Environment.cfg
with the one here. It has many more settings, and lta retrieve/query
won't probably work without them. Don't forget to update user name
and password there with yours.

Then you can use it like:
lta-query.py -p LT3_001
giving the project number. It will create corresponding *.csv file listing all data files
for this project.

Then you can use this file as input for lta-retrieve.py, e.g.:

lta-retrieve.py [-u] [--summary-only] --csvfile <file> <ObsID 1> <ObsID 2> ... <ObsID N>

or you can skip lta-query.py and rather use --query and -p options directly for lta-retrieve.py,
but then every call of the script will be slow as the same query will be done every time.
